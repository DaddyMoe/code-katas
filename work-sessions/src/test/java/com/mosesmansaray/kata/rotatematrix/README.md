h1. Matrix Rotation


Challenge:
==========

Taking as input a NxN matrix of numbers, rotate it by 90 degrees.
The input matrix will always be a 2-dimensional table of numbers, with the same number of columns as rows. There are no nulls and only numbers.

Example:

Input:
======

1 2 3 4  
5 6 7 8  
9 a b c  
d e f g

Output:
=======

d 9 5 1  
e a 6 2  
f b 7 3  
g c 8 4

Stretch Goal:

Rotate a matrix of NxM numbers, where the two sides of the matrix have different lengths.
